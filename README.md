# Facial Recognition based Attendance App
The core Python backend for the Facial Recognition Attendance System. This server-side component is responsible for real-time face detection and recognition, leveraging OpenCV and machine learning to process data and authenticate users for attendance marking.

## Key Features

- Real-Time Biometric Processing: Achieves real-time face detection and recognition leveraging OpenCV and specialized machine learning models.
- Seamless Attendance Marking: Enables reliable and fast attendance marking for users through the integrated system.
- Geofencing Integration: Implements logic to check the user's reported GPS coordinates against a predefined boundary (e.g., campus or office location) to ensure attendance is only marked from authorized physical areas.
